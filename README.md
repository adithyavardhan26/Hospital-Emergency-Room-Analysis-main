# Hospital Emergency Room Analysis

## üè• Project Overview

This project involves analyzing hospital emergency room (ER) data to gain insights into patient inflow, wait times, resource utilization, and performance metrics. The aim is to help hospital administrators identify bottlenecks, improve patient satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

| File / Item | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Hospital Data.xlsx` | Raw dataset containing emergency room patient information: timestamps, arrival methods, triage categories, etc. |
| `Hospital.pbix` | Power BI report file visualizing dashboards around ER performance, wait times, patient volume etc. |
| `Hospital.png` | Image / snapshot of one or more dashboard visualizations (for quick preview). |
| `README.md` | This document. Describes the project, how to use the files, and key findings. |

## üîç Key Questions Explored / Analyses Performed

Some of the analyses and insights you‚Äôll find in this project:

- Trends in ER patient arrivals (by hour, day, week)  
- Average and distribution of **wait times** (from arrival ‚Üí triage ‚Üí treatment)  
- Breakdown of patients by **triage severity / category**  
- Peak times and how they correlate with resource constraints (staff, beds)  
- Bottlenecks in flow (e.g. long triage queues, long delays before doctor assessment)  
- Recommendations for performance improvements based on data  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g. handling missing timestamps, outliers)  
- Data visualization, reporting & dashboards using **Power BI**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, anomalies, and distribution of variables  
- Time-based analysis (hour of day, day of week)  
- Performance and operational metrics analysis (wait times, delays, utilization)

## ‚öô How To Use / Reproduce

1. **Open the dataset** (`Hospital Data.xlsx`) in Excel / a data tool to view raw data.  
2. **Load the data into Power BI** using `Hospital.pbix` to view & interact with dashboards.  
3. If needed, replicate / modify analyses:  
   - Filter by date/time to see specific periods.  
   - Drill down by triage level / patient severity / arrival type.  
   - Compare performance across time (e.g. weekdays vs weekends).

## üìä Key Findings & Recommendations

*(You may fill this section with actual findings once your analysis is complete)*

- High patient arrival peaks occur between **[xxx] and [yyy]**, resulting in increased wait times.  
- Triage area is a bottleneck: average wait from arrival to triage is **X minutes**, with long tail delays.  
- Patients of [certain triage category] frequently experience longer delays before being seen by a doctor.  
- Recommendations: increase staffing during peak arrival hours, streamline triage process, allocate more beds/resources in bottleneck areas.

## üîÆ Possible Extensions

- Add predictive modeling (forecast ER arrival volumes)  
- Incorporate more data such as patient outcomes, readmissions  
- Build a web dashboard or embed dashboards for live monitoring  
- Analyze patient satisfaction or outcome metrics versus wait times
